## Comments

This is a re-submission to fix the failed tests on r-devel-windows-ix86+x86_64.

## Test environments
 
* Via Win-builder
 - Windows Server 2008 (64-bit), R-devel

### Check results

The test environment replicated the error with version 0.2-4.

This submission (0.2-5), passes with no error/warnings.

There remains a note regarding possibly invalid URLs/DOIs which I believe is a false alarm as I have checked these URLs/DOIs. It may be due to a captcha challenge. They are all links to jstor.org.
